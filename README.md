# webGPU_playground
A playground for me to familiarize with webGPU, may include multiple projects in the future for fun

WebGPU implementation of Conway's Game of Life based on a tutorial at https://codelabs.developers.google.com/your-first-webgpu-app#2. Used to familiarize myself with webGPU. Finished with added features of a generation counter and a method of making only specific cells active rather than randomly chosen.
